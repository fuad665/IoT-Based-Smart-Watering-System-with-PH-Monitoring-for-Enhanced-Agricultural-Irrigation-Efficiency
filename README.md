## 📌 Overview

This project proposes a smart IoT-based irrigation system that **automates water delivery based on real-time soil moisture and pH levels**, aiming to improve agricultural efficiency, sustainability, and yield. Using **ESP32**, **soil moisture and pH sensors**, a **relay-controlled pump**, and the **Blynk cloud platform**, the system allows farmers to monitor and manage irrigation remotely.
